		Here's a real life example. Last month I was couchsurfing in Atlanta for a couple of days. I was staying with a nice host (see pic on the right), who was hosting three random couchsurfers: a Texan, a German, and me. Besides, giving each of us a separate bedroom, he got us into a community swimming pool for free. It was a 20 minute drive. When he filled up the gas tank, nobody offered to contribute to the gas. So when we went shopping for food together, I secretly told the other two guests, "Let's split the food bill between the three of us so that the host doesn't pay anything."

		The German was cool with the idea, but the Texan was reluctant because he had already gifted the host two tiny plants and some homemade sweets. He felt he had done his good deed and didn't need to do more. "Besides," he said, "When I host, I'm pretty generous myself."

		The food bill was $46. It contained all the ingredients to make pizza plus various other items that the host needed. I put it all on my credit card. The German, who was a 19-year-old student, contributed $20. The 32-year-old Texan gave $6 "because that's what I would pay for a pizza." 

		The host made pizza for all of us. I was basically the only one who helped the host cook and clean up. The other guests just waited in the dining room to be served. 

		The Texan would stay for two nights. Is two nights in a house with your own bedroom, warm showers, and wifi connection worth a bit more than two tiny plants and sweets? Like most couchsurfers, the Texan was tight on cash, yet he did have a Macbook Air computer, so he wasn't utterly destitute. This raises the question....

		How much should you give?

		There are two ways of thinking about it:

		Consider what you are costing the host in water, electricity, and food, and make sure you give him back at least that much. That usually translates to $5-10 per day, depending on the cost of living where the host lives. Be generous.
		Perhaps an even better way to look at it is to consider the value of what the host is delivering to you. You're often getting shelter, shower, clean sheets, towel, a concierge, laundry, and computer/wifi. Sometimes you also get food, transportation, and a tour guide. To get all that from a cheap hostel, you would have to spend at least $20/night and probably much more. Therefore, spending $5-10/night on your couchsurfing host is a good deal for you and will make your host feel appreciated. If you're short on cash, give them your free labor for one hour.
		Although this is all common sense, it amazes me how many couchsurfers just take, take, take and don't give back economically. I almost never host (because I'm usually traveling), but my hosts tell me about selfish couchsurfers. These couchsurfers think, "But I give back by sharing my amazing travel stories about my awesome and wonderful life!"
